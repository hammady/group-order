<h2>IMPORTANT CHANGE</h2>
Order System has been changed a little. There are some rules to organize orders.
<ol>
	<li>Saeed (office boy) will manage orders. He will call shops, collect money, and distribute food</li>
	<li>Everyone <u>must</u> pay when he/she receives food</li>
	<li>All notes must be written in Arabic. No francoarab is allowed</li>
	<li>For any help or assistance, contact Alaa</li>
</ol>
You must agree to be able to continue using order system. Thank you for your cooperation.
